I've toyed with the idea of starting a blog for a long time. Actually, there's even been several (failed) attempts to get into it. With the excitement of sending words out into the void came many doubts about who would read my essays, whether I had original ideas worth expressing, and whether writing was something important enough for me to put time into. "What will X think when I write about Y?" "What if my employer reads that opinion?" "Is this really something worth putting my time into?"

Those doubts crept in, and I let their mere presence be enough to dissuade me from ever making a serious attempt for a long time. But between my increased awareness of our cultural climate, as well as my changing point in life, other questions arose that painted a different light on the doubts. Let me explain.

I'm 25. My grandfather did not take me seriously when I mentioned around my birthday that I could feel the onset of my quarter-life crisis. Plainly, there's a _a lot_ to be anxious about. At a macro-scale, political polarization is driving a level of incivility that we haven't seen in decades. Social media seems to be fueling a movement to silence wrongthink in favor of protecting self-esteem. International tensions are uncomfortable, to say the absolute least. At a micro-scale, my family keeps getting older and I'm 2000 miles away. One of my best friends just got engaged, with more likely to follow.

On one hand, I'm _only_ 25, and can easily admit to knowing basically nothing about life. But on the other, the clock is ticking. It feels like I'm wrapping up the setup turn in _Settlers of Catan_: the game really has barely started, but it sets the tone for the entire game. Now's the time I need to put intention into the habits I build for myself that are going to set the foundation for nearly every aspect of my life. My health will impact how I can be there for my present and future family, my ability to reason and discuss will impact the work I do and the relationships I have, and maybe most fundamentally, the outlook and worldview I establish will determine my satisfaction with what I will have built by the time I reach my expiration date.

So then the question becomes, _what if I don't write?_

What if I continue to let my passing thoughts and opinions go unvetted? What if I get asked to share an opinion on an important subject, and I really only have a surface-level understanding that doesn't take into account nuance?  Most dangerously, what if this _modus operandi_ becomes my default? This, then, is my personal incentive: to sharpen the blade. Without doing so, I risk the softening of my mind and losing my capability to grow. And unfortunately, with these bodies of ours, there's rarely much treading water. You either sink or swim; you grow and actively maintain, or you stagnate.

_Okay, Michael,_ I hear you saying, _then just go talk things over with your friends over some brews, and don't bother the rest of the world with your petty ramblings._ This too has been a doubt of mine. Twitter and Fox and CNN make enough noise as it is, so why add to it? What do I possibly have to contribute?

The answer to this question has been a bit more difficult, but I've come to the conclusion that our nation is at a turning point. Tensions are high just about everywhere you look. Unemployment is rising.[^fn1] Politics are at a stalemate. Our culture is rotting. Our ability and intention to seek truth are dwindling, and mainstream coverage of the news is not helping. Public policy seems to be more shaped by public greed than national interest. And through all of this, we seem to decide that the correct response is to get upset, to point fingers, or to subscribe to apathy and ignore what's going on. None of these options make me excited to bring children into the world. If the only options are to sink or swim, I'm not convinced we're swimming. What's one to do in circumstances like these?

[^fn1]: I'm not referring to the official statistic for the number of people actively seeking a job. I'm referring to labor force participation rate, as outlined by Andrew Yang in his [_War on Normal People_](https://www.amazon.com/War-Normal-People-Disappearing-Universal-ebook/dp/B075CRY4TZ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=war+on+normal+people&qid=1600576041&sr=8-1). The discussed in headlines probably doesn't refer to what you think it does. We'll talk about it later.

The answer is to engage. Why should we allow the hoards on Twitter or the news anchors on CNN or Fox to shape the public narrative? These media encourage polarization, action based on misinformation, and allow no room for nuance. For those stuck inside the bubble, I write to draw the curtain and reveal a world that is not black and white. For those alienated by the sensationalism, I write to offer a nuanced perspective worth chewing on. For future generations, I write to call out today's failures for what they are so that we may build a brighter tomorrow.

To this end, I consider it a responsibility to write. I don't have all the answers, and the impact of my content will probably be minimal, but I can only improve the world by improving myself, and that starts with opening myself up for civil discourse. The only way we fix this country is by incrementalism, and I choose to move forward.

I write to take my thoughts to conclusions. I publish to take them out of the vacuum of my head. I express these values to encourage civil discourse.
